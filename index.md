### Near-term fire weather forecasting in the Pacific Northwest using 500-hPa map types
[Humphrey, R., Saltenberger, J., Abatzoglou, J. T., & Cullen, A. C. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1071/WF23117)

**Background.** Near-term forecasts of fire danger based on predicted surface weather and fuel dryness are widely used to support the decisions of wildfire managers. The incorporation of synoptic-scale upper-air patterns into predictive models may provide additional value in operational forecasting. **Aims.** In this study, we assess the impact of synoptic-scale upper-air patterns on the occurrence of large wildfires and widespread fire outbreaks in the US Pacific Northwest. Additionally, we examine how discrete upper-air map types can augment subregional models of wildfire risk. **Methods.** We assess the statistical relationship between synoptic map types, surface weather and wildfire occurrence. Additionally, we compare subregional fire danger models to identify the predictive value contributed by upper-air map types. **Key results.** We find that these map types explain variation in wildfire occurrence not captured by fire danger indices based on surface weather alone, with specific map types associated with significantly higher expected daily ignition counts in half of the subregions. **Conclusions.** We observe that incorporating upper-air map types enhances the explanatory power of subregional fire danger models. **Implications.** Our approach provides value to operational wildfire management and provides a template for how these methods may be implemented in other regions.

### Growing convergence research: Coproducing climate projections to inform proactive decisions for managing simultaneous wildfire risk
[Cullen, A. C., Prichard, S. J., Abatzoglou, J. T., Dolk, A., Kessenich, L., Bloem, S., Bukovsky, M. S., Humphrey, R., McGinnis, S., Skinner, H., & Mearns, L. O. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.14113)

We apply a convergence research approach to the urgent need for proactive management of long-term risk associated with wildfire in the United States. In this work we define convergence research in accordance with the US National Science Foundation — as a means of addressing a specific and compelling societal problem for which solutions require deep integration across disciplines and engagement of stakeholders. Our research team brings expertise in climate science, fire science, landscape ecology, and decision science to address the risk from simultaneous and impactful fires that compete for management resources, and leverages climate projections for decision support. In order to make progress toward convergence our team bridges spatial and temporal scale divides arising from differences in disciplinary and practice-based norms. We partner with stakeholders representing US governmental, tribal, and local decision contexts to coproduce a robust information base for support of decision making about wildfire preparedness and proactive land/fire management. Our approach ensures that coproduced information will be directly integrated into existing tools for application in operations and policy making. Coproduced visualizations and decision support information provide projections of the change in expected number of fires that compete for resources, the number of fire danger days per year relative to prior norms, and changes in the length and overlap of fire season in multiple US regions. Continuing phases of this work have been initiated both by stakeholder communities and by our research team, a demonstration of impact and value.

### Beyond Legal Deserts: Access to Counsel for Immigrants Facing Removal
[Ryo, E., & Humphrey, R. (2023)](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/nclr101&i=790)

Removal proceedings are high-stakes adversarial proceedings in which immigration judges must decide whether to allow immigrants who allegedly have violated U.S. immigration laws to stay in the United States or to order them deported to their countries of origin. In these proceedings, the government trial attorneys prosecute noncitizens who often lack English fluency, economic resources, and familiarity with our legal system. Yet, most immigrants in removal proceedings do not have legal representation, as removal is considered to be a civil matter and courts have not recognized a right to government­appointed counsel for immigrants facing removal. Advocates, policymakers, and scholars have described this situation as an access-to-justice crisis or a representation crisis for immigrant communities. The prevailing wisdom suggests that the solution to this crisis is more lawyers or more nonlawyer practitioners, such as accredited representatives and legal technicians, who can provide affordable and quality legal services. The focus, therefore, has been on the ubiquity of "legal deserts," commonly defined as areas that are in shortage of lawyers, and on ways to increase the supply of legal service providers in the marketplace.

This Article presents an empirical study of legal representation that unsettles this prevailing wisdom by showing why an adequate supply of legal service providers is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition to address the representation crisis. Our study uses a new and original dataset that we compiled for the purposes of this study on immigration lawyers and non-detained immigrant respondents in removal proceedings. Our findings suggest that although the focus on the supply­side dimension of the representation crisis is important, it obscures other complex sets of barriers to obtaining legal representation that are distinct from the problem of legal deserts. Specifically, our empirical analyses show that whether a non-detained immigrant respondent obtains legal representation is predicted by where they reside, their primary language, and the size of their conational social networks, controlling for the availability of practicing immigration lawyers in close proximity to their places of residence and other potential confounders. In short, we argue that geography, language, and networks are destiny for immigrant respondents when it comes to obtaining legal representation. Thus, addressing the representation crisis requires looking beyond the problem of legal deserts to attend to a variety of other hurdles to obtaining legal representation that are associated with certain geographical, linguistic, and social isolation in which many immigrants live.

### Citizenship Disparities
[Ryo, E., & Humphrey, R. (2022)](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/mnlr107&i=12)

Citizenship is “nothing less than the right to have rights,” wrote Chief Justice Warren in his dissent in Perez v. Brownell. Yet no study to date has been able to systematically investigate agency decisions to grant or deny citizenship in an administrative process called naturalization adjudication. This Article presents the first comprehensive empirical study of contemporary naturalization adjudication outcomes in the United States. Drawing on new and unique administrative data that we obtained through extensive Freedom of Information Act litigation, this study analyzes over 2.6 million naturalization decisions made by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) between 2015 and 2018. These decisions were made by 87 USCIS field offices located throughout the United States.

First, our analysis provides critical new insights on the extent and nature of inequalities present in the naturalization adjudication system. Specifically, our findings reveal large and troubling disparities across USCIS field offices in approval rates and adjudication times. For example, some field offices have predicted approval rates that are as low as 79 percent while others have predicted approval rates that are as high as 97 percent. Likewise, there are wide variations in adjudication times: Average predicted adjudication times are as low as 136 days in some field offices while others are as high as 266 days. Second, our analysis shows that some of the key predictors of approvals and adjudication times are racial, political, and economic climates of local communities in which the field offices are located. For example, approval odds are significantly lower for applications adjudicated by field offices located in White-majority counties and in Republican counties. In addition, the higher the unemployment rate, the lower the approval odds. In terms of adjudication time, one of the key predictors of longer adjudication time is the location of the field office in an enforcement-focused county.

These results are consistent with our argument that citizenship is the ultimate form of social closure, and naturalization adjudication is a powerful tool of boundary policing in service of that social closure. Although U.S. Constitution requires uniform national standards for naturalization adjudication, in practice boundary policing occurs at the local level. Therefore, field offices’ local contexts play an important role in shaping agency decisions on naturalization applications. This study builds on growing legal scholarship that emphasizes the importance of geographical decentralization in the development of the contemporary federal administrative state. The current study’s findings make unique theoretical and empirical contributions to an emerging body of research that documents deeply troubling disparities in administrative and judicial decisionmaking in immigration law. We conclude by discussing some of the key policy implications of these findings for citizenship and the need for equality, consistency, and transparency in naturalization adjudication.

### The importance of race, gender, and religion in naturalization adjudication in the United States
[Ryo, E., & Humphrey, R. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2114430119)

This study presents an empirical investigation of naturalization adjudication in the United States using new administrative data on naturalization applications decided by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services between October 2014 and March 2018. We find significant group disparities in naturalization approvals based on applicants’ race/ethnicity, gender, and religion, controlling for individual applicant characteristics, adjudication years, and variation between field offices. Non-White applicants and Hispanic applicants are less likely to be approved than non-Hispanic White applicants, male applicants are less likely to be approved than female applicants, and applicants from Muslim-majority countries are less likely to be approved than applicants from other countries. In addition, race/ethnicity, gender, and religion interact to produce a certain group hierarchy in naturalization approvals. For example, the probability of approval for Black males is 5 percentage points smaller than that of White females. The probability of approval for Blacks from Muslim-majority countries is 9 percentage points smaller than that of Whites from other countries. The probability of approval for females from Muslim-majority countries is 6 percentage points smaller than that of females from other countries. This study contributes to our understanding of the nature of inequalities present in agency decision-making in the naturalization process.

### Children in Custody: A Study of Detained Migrant Children in the United States
[Ryo, E., & Humphrey, R. (2021)](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/uclalr68&i=144)

Every year, tens of thousands of migrant children are taken into custody by U.S. immigration authorities. Many of these children are unaccompanied by parents or relatives when they arrive at the U.S. border. Others who are accompanied by parents or relatives are rendered unaccompanied when U.S. immigration authorities separate them upon apprehension. Together, these minors are called unaccompanied alien children (UACs) and transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), unless and until their immigration cases are resolved or until the children can be placed with a sponsor in the United States pending the adjudication of their immigration cases. In fiscal year 2019, the ORR held the highest number of UACs in its UAC program history.

This study presents the first systematic empirical investigation of children in ORR custody using original administrative records pertaining to migrant children who were in ORR custody between November 2017 and August 2019. Our analysis reveals an increasing number and proportion of children in U.S. custody who are extremely vulnerable: girls, young children of tender age (260 of whom are U.S. citizens), and children emigrating from countries with high rates of crime and violence. This trend suggests that insofar as punitive immigration enforcement policies may have deterred some children from undertaking the dangerous journey to the United States, those who continue to arrive at the U.S. border are likely children who are most in need of special care and legal protection.

Yet our analysis raises serious questions about the system’s capacity to afford such care and protection. We find that most migrant children held in custody were concentrated in a small number of states, which are different from the states in which their sponsors reside. Only about 11 percent of children reunified were discharged from facilities located in the same state as their sponsors’ states of residence. In addition, most migrant children were in facilities that are extremely large—for example, shelters with capacities of 100 or more children. We also find deep inequalities in the system that suggest that custodial experiences and outcomes of UACs in ORR custody are closely tied to the particular facility and type of program in which a child happens to be placed. Among other findings, our analysis shows that the median time to reunification varies widely between facilities. For example, one ORR shelter’s median time to reunification was nearly eight times as high as that of another ORR shelter. We discuss the policy implications of these findings and consider critical issues that require further investigation—issues that are central to evaluating how, whether, and to what extent the U.S. government is fulfilling its moral and legal obligation to protect migrant children inside our borders.

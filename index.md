## ESIIL Data Short Course


## burn_viz
The burn_viz project provides a novel way of visualizing areas that have burned over multiple years. 
In addition to wildfire perimeters, the web application shows population density and landcover type. 
Viewing these spatial layers simultaneously allows users to discover relationships, generate research questions, and consider policy implications. 

The application is accessible at [shinyapps.io](https://reedhum.shinyapps.io/burn_viz/), and the source code and data are published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11377359).
